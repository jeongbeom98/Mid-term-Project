# Yoga Sequence Builder

## Introduction
Yoga Sequence Builder is a web application designed to allow users to create, view, update, and delete yoga sequences. This project serves as a submission for the Mid-term Project assignment. It's built using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend, providing a simple yet intuitive interface for managing yoga sequences.

## Project Objectives
- To create a virtual environment for Python projects.
- To set up FastAPI projects and create CRUD API endpoints.
- To connect the front end with the back end using HTTP calls.
- To demonstrate the ability to develop a full-stack web application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 12+
- A modern web browser

### Setting Up the Backend
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Start the FastAPI server: uvicorn main:app --reload

### Setting Up the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory within the project.
2. Install the necessary Node.js dependencies: npm install
3. Start the React development server: npm start

## Usage
- The application can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.
- The backend API documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
- Users can add, view, update, and delete yoga sequences through the web interface.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for yoga sequences.
- **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface that works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation for all backend endpoints.

## Project Structure
- `/backend`: Contains all backend-related files, including FastAPI app and models.
- `/frontend`: Contains React app components, styles, and scripts for the frontend interface.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies for the backend.
- `package.json`: Lists all Node.js dependencies for the frontend.
